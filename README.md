# OBD2 Arduino Car Reader

## Summary

I built and created a device using an arduino and a freematics OBD2 adapter to interface with the car's computer codes and print them to a screen.

## Why?
I was listening to a DEFCON talk about car hacking and I wanted to see what I could learn from the cars internal computers and do myself.
I knew there was an OBD2 port that the maintenance people at car shops would use to view the diagnostics of a car, but what else could we gather from this port? Can we send/recieve data?
